#TotalVision Edge Computing Prototype

Implentation of several machine learning models on a raspberry pi 4 with camera to
produce pseudo-real-time inferences based on face detection and classification.

The prototype tests the following functions
- Face Detection using a Haar Cascade Classifier model
- Age classification from a face image using a Caffe dNN model
- Gender classification from a face image using a Caffe dNN model
- Emotion classification from a face image using a Tensorflow CNN
